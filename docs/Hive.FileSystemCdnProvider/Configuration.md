# Configuration

The CDN Provider allows Hive to locally store uploaded mod files on the file system.

## `CdnObjectsSubfolder` - `string`

This is a relative path to a subfolder where Hive will store uploaded mod files. By default, this subfolder is `cdn/objects`.

## `CdnMetadataSubfolder` - `string`

This is a relative path to a subfolder where Hive will store the metadata files for each uploaded file. By default, this subfolder is `cdn/metadata`.

This is intentionally different from the Objects folder, so the maintainer can easily control access to the Objects folder and the Metadata folder.

## `PublicUrlBase` - `string`

This is the base URL that the CDN Provider will use to generate download links for uploaded files. If you are running a reverse proxy, or need to point to a different URL entirely for the CDN, define it here. If ommitted, Hive will generate the base URL from the request context (in most cases, this will be `localhost`).

Note that Hive will expand upon this URL for the final download link. The final download link will be generated by combining all of the following parts together:

1. The public URL base (or a generated URL base)
2. The CDN Objects subfolder
3. The location of the CDN object within the subfolder

For example, assuming all configuration options are set to defaults, a download link might look like this: `https://localhost:5001/cdn/objects/CDN-OBJECT-GUID/cdn-object.dll`
